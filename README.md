# Cat Gif Net - UCSD Extension Full Stack Boot Camp Class Activity 
If you've had a bad day at work and all you want to do is sit down, push a button, and watch silly cat gifs, this is it!

## Dev Notes
This was an exercise that we did in class using APIs

## Version
02.04.2020 Barebones version with no styling. Just a button that pulls as many Cat Gifs as you can stand. Just keep clicking the button and keep consuming cat gifs!
